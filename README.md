# 🎯 Football Player Valuation Analysis: Identifying Market Inefficiencies

## 📋 Project Overview
This analysis identifies systematic market inefficiencies in football player valuation using data science techniques. By analyzing 17,954 professional players, we uncover how teams can build competitive squads at 20% of traditional costs through data-driven player acquisition strategies.

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Veterans are undervalued by up to €80M** despite maintaining elite skills
- **Player market value peaks at age 27**, not later as commonly believed  
- **The "sweet spot" for value is players rated 82-85**, not superstars
- **Veterans provide 3x better performance per wage euro** vs young players

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **SQL** (SQLite, Complex queries)
- **Data Analysis** (Statistical analysis, Financial ratios)
